# Example of bootstrap App

Here are some examples of bootstrap App.
## PDF example
This is an example to play a PDF document. The HTML file uses different files:
  * example.pdf: the PDF file that will be play,
  * style.css: a CSS file,
  * logger.js: an external JavaScript file used to log on screen.

The manifest file lists these files and launches the player.html file.
The build.cmd file is used to build the bootstrap archive.
