#  Subtitles

Gekkota supports both **WebVTT** and **SRT** subtitles. The SRT support has been added to be used in the same way that WebVTT is.
You can find an HTML example using this API [here.](example1.html)

**Build note**: You need to execute the **build.cmd** file to generate the boostrap app. Otherwise there will be a mismatch between the html file name and the one the manifest tries to launch. Find more information in *SDK-G4/bootstrap App/* documentation.
